```

#### **‚úÖ WHY INDICATORS MATTER**
1. **User Familiarity**: Most traders expect RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
2. **Signal Confirmation**: Enigma + traditional indicators = higher confidence
3. **Market Conditions**: Different indicators work in different market states
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Advanced indicator combinations

#### **üéØ RECOMMENDED INDICATOR STRATEGY**
```python
# Core Indicators to Implement:
ESSENTIAL_INDICATORS = [
    "RSI",           # Momentum
    "MACD",          # Trend following
    "Bollinger_Bands", # Volatility
    "ATR",           # Volatility/Risk
    "Volume_Profile", # Market structure
    "Support_Resistance", # Key levels
]

# Advanced Indicators:
ADVANCED_INDICATORS = [
    "Market_Profile", # Institutional levels
    "Order_Flow",     # Smart money tracking
    "Sentiment_Index", # Market psychology
    "Volatility_Index", # VIX-style indicators
]
```

#### **üìà CUSTOM PLOTTING CAPABILITIES**
1. **Interactive Charts**: TradingView-style interface
2. **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: 1m to 1D+ charts
3. **Custom Drawing Tools**: Trend lines, Fibonacci, patterns
4. **Overlay Capabilities**: Enigma signals on price charts
5. **Export Features**: Save/share chart analysis

### **üöÄ COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION**
