### Core System Architecture
```
AlgoBox OCR → Python Backend → Kelly/ATR/Cadence Logic → 
Apex Compliance → Guardian Decision → NinjaScript Dashboard + Mobile Control
```

### 1. OCR Engine (AlgoBox Enigma Reading)
**Requirements:**
- Real-time reading of AlgoBox Enigma panel (NO API ACCESS)
- Screen capture at 10-20 FPS using mss library
- Multi-engine approach: Tesseract + EasyOCR + OpenCV

- Confluence levels (L1-L4 buttons)
- MACVU filter state (green/red/neutral)
- Signal success/failure count for cadence tracking

**Technical Implementation:**
- Screen region mapping via JSON configuration
- Color detection using OpenCV

- Fallback systems for misreads

### 2. Enigma Cadence Logic
**Rules:**
- Track consecutive failed Enigma signals
- AM session threshold: 2 failures
- PM session threshold: 3 failures
- Reset counter on winning signal
